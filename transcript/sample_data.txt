David Ushery (01:41):

Good evening, everyone from 30 Rock, and welcome to the first Democratic primary debate for New York City mayor. I'm joined by my colleague, News 4 governor affairs reporter, Melissa Russo, Sally Goldenberg, senior New York editor for Politico, and Telemundo 47 anchor, Rosarina Breton. This is a two-hour debate live on all NBC New York and Telemundo 47 streaming and digital platforms, Politico.com, TeleXitos, and YouTube. This first hour, also live on channel four, the leading democratic contenders are here tonight. Their positions on stage were chosen by random draw. Few rules for the candidates for traditional question and answer, you'll have one minute to respond and we'll offer 30-second rebuttals at the moderator's discretion. We'll also be asking some questions where… We're looking for shorter answers, a lot of ground we want to cover, candidates. And we also reserve the right to cut off your microphone if you ignore the rules, but, of course, we don't want to do that, the goal is here for you to hear each other and for New Yorkers to hear everything you have to say. Good luck to you all. We'll begin with Melissa Russo.

Melissa Russo (02:45):

Thank you, David. Good evening, everyone. It's good to have you. We're going to begin tonight with the issue that polls show is number one for New Yorkers, and that is affordability. The cost of everything is squeezing residents in our city. New housing can take years to build, and we'll get to your plans on that a little bit later in the debate, but right now, we're interested in how you would help residents immediately. So what's your one big idea to make the city more affordable now and how will you pay for it? We'll begin with you, Ms. Adams.

Adrienne Adams (03:19):

Thank you so much. Thank you for having me this evening. I'm actually the only candidate on this stage who is actually doing the work already. We have a housing plan already. I have built and delivered 120,000 new units of housing, and now with the new proposal that we have in front of us, we have over 80,000 new units of housing that will be coming up and will be affordable to the people of the city of New York. New York is not affordable. I'm a mother, a grandmother, and I want my children to stay here just like real New Yorkers want their children to stay here.
